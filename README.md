## Title

A Comparison of Security Culture with Securing a Physical Home

## Overview

Security culture is a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that includes various policies and practices to protect an organization's assets from cyber threats. In many ways, the principles of security culture can be compared to securing a physical home. By examining each module of security culture, we can draw parallels to securing a physical home and develop a comprehensive understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and physical security measures.

## Modules

### Awareness Training
Security culture: Educating employees about the importance of cybersecurity and how to recognize potential threats.<br>
Physical home: Educating family members about locking doors and windows, not sharing keys, and being vigilant about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. <br>

### Password Management
Security culture: Guidelines for creating and maintaining strong passwords, as well as rules around password sharing and storage. <br>
Physical home: Creating and storing secure passwords for alarm systems and home security apps, as well as avoiding the use of easily guessable codes for garage door openers and other devices. <br>

### Access Control
Security culture: Outlining who has access to sensitive information, and how that access is granted, monitored, and revoked. <br>
Physical home: Setting rules for who has keys or access codes to the house, and monitoring who enters and leaves the premises. <br>

### Incident Response Plan
Security culture: A step-by-step guide to follow in the event of a security breach or cyber attack. <br>
Physical home: Contacting law enforcement, securing the premises, and documenting any damage or stolen property in the event of a break-in or security breach. <br>

### Risk Assessment
Security culture: Identifying and prioritizing potential vulnerabilities and threats to the organization's security. <br>
Physical home: Conducting a risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as poorly lit areas, weak locks, or easy access points, and taking steps to address them. <br>

### Third-Party Management
Security culture: Addressing the security risks posed by vendors, contractors, and other third-party providers. <br>
Physical home: Vetting and monitoring contractors, cleaners, and other service providers who may have access to the property. <br>

### Physical Security
Security culture: Measures to secure physical assets and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas. <br>
Physical home: Installing and maintaining security cameras, alarms, and other devices to deter burglars and detect unauthorized access. <br>
